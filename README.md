## Description
Airbnb clone website built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Originally kept on my local machine but recently uploaded to GitHub after some lengthy compatibility issues.

## Rationale 
I really like the interface and functionality of Airbnb's website, so I wanted to see if I could make something similar. This project helped me gain a good introduction to React and full-stack development.

## How to run the project locally
- To be updated!

## Credits 
Majority of the source code and styles are adapted from the YouTube channel "Coding with Dawid".
