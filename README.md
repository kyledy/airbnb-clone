## Description
Airbnb clone website built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. 

## Rationale 
I really like the interface and functionality of Airbnb's website, so I wanted to see if I could make something similar. This project helped me gain a good introduction to React and full-stack development.

## How to run the project locally
- Make sure that you have Node.js installed on your computer. 
- Clone the repository onto your local machine.
- Open an instance of the terminal.
- Navigate to the client folder.
- Run "npm install".
- Run "yarn".
- Run "yarn dev".
- You should be presented with a localhost link to the application. Follow the link and enjoy!
